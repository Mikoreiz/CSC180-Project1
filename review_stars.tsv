Being vegetarian really the only place to go is Burger King.

For my vegetarian sandwich I asked for mayo (which they charged me .75 for) and yup that wasn't on there either. The person taking our order must have been doing something else brig the fact that I had to repeat myself 6 times and then drive thru girl well let's just say her attitude wasn't any better.

-LfTBo0oa_uD454ScEW2XA	3.0	"b'I can\'t help but feel that the foodies who love this place only do so with a kind of hipster irony.  \n\nWhen ordering at Merry-Ann\'s, ""Occam\'s razor"" applies: go with the simple choices.  See a particular dish on the menu that you\'d consider ordering?  First, imagine yourself cooking it at home...now count all of the potential steps where poor decision-making or lack of skill could result in disaster.  Choose the dish where there is little room for error and you\'re set.\n\nOn my first, misguided visit to Merry-Ann\'s, my youthful enthusiasm (and naivete) led me to order the Mexican omelet.  What was I expecting?  Maybe an egg-licious concoction with chorizo and peppers.  Instead I got something akin to a burrito with scoops of taco meat, where the thin skin of egg acted as a wrap.  I openly and unashamedly admit that I am a snob in this regard--due to early childhood trauma involving Taco Bell, I simply refuse to consume oily ground beef cooked with packets of ""Mexican-flavored"" seasonings.  The meal didn\'t make it far past ""Go"" before it had to take a few steps back...  Err.\n\nWith that experience behind me, I still gladly stop by Merry-Ann\'s, but now I stick with those simple dishes, like eggs, breakfast meat, and hash browns.  All the breakfast combination plates are pretty reasonably priced and the serving sizes are more than adequate.  I don\'t recommend the dinner items (remember Occam\'s razor?).\n\nThe overall ambiance of the place is above average.  Compared to campus-town\'s IHOP, Merry-Ann\'s is bright and clean.  The kitchen isn\'t in a separate room, which allows you to observe that a good deal of the food items are microwaved.  Maybe those people who have food industry experience wouldn\'t be surprised or bothered, but most places aren\'t quite so brazen about the nature of food preparation.\n\nFor standard breakfasts, Merry-Ann\'s is a solid choice, especially as it\'s the only real 24-hour game in town and within easy walking distance of all the downtown bars.  Still, I\'d recommend keeping your expectations low.'"

Tonight on the other hand has been a different experience all together. This is the first Monday night I\'ve ever been here and even the atmosphere is different. Every time I come here I play music on the ""Touchtunes"" jukebox...tonight tho...I bought $20 worth of credit on the jukebox and knowing that we were going to be here for a while I played a significant amount of music, at my expense, on the jukebox. About 2 minutes into the second song I play I hear the waitress, who I have never seen before, starts speaking poorly of the music selection to other diners...very loudly and completely conspicuously thinking that who ever played the music had already left...completely rude. The wonderful cook, a very polite young lady, was the star of the night making sure our coffee stayed full and thoroughly apologized for what happened.

While we\'ve seen a lot of mobile vendors appearing downtown in that time, none of them come close to the Chili Man in terms of quality or taste.\n\nHe\'s not called ""the Chili Man"" for nothing. His homemade chili is award-winning stuff, garnering prizes at multiple local and state chili cook-offs. It\'s so good you could eat it by the gallon. (And if you let him know in advance, he\'ll sell you a gallon so you can give it a try.)\n\nVic toasts his buns, uses high-quality dogs, and also makes his own spicy mustard. He has all the toppings you could want, including slaw, cheese, and kraut. He even makes a great chicken salad that you can get on a croissant. (Not available every day.)\n\nOn top of all that, he\'s got a great personality and is a blast to talk to while he\'s making your dogs. He\'s only there from 11-3pm on Wednesdays and Fridays, so you need to plan ahead.\n\nI\'m going to go out on a limb here and proclaim this the best dog in Charlotte. Seriously.'"

But I decided to stop in to put $1.50 of my hard-earned skrilla to good use to the tune of 10 chicken nuggets with some bbq sauce.  When I arrived home, I threw on The Amazing Race Season 5 and resumed watching where I had left off while double (hell sometimes even TRIPLE) dipping my nuggs in the aforementioned sauce.  All was well.  Or so I thought...\n\nI then woke up disoriented on the couch about 6 AM, feeling like my stomach had suddenly reached the furthermost depths of pain and discomfort.  I felt sick.  I was sure I was food-poisoned.  All I could taste was the nugget remnants mixed with the taste of the vomit I was sure I was about to spew everywhere.\n\nAlthough I stayed by the toilet feeling miserable for over half an hour, I somehow made a miraculous recovery and avoided puking and was able to fall back asleep.  It was like a sign from God; a warning.  No more BK.\n\nSo next time you get the craving to ""have it your way""- unless ""your way"" is lying on a bathroom floor at 6 AM with your head on the toilet asking the good Lord to just take you, remember this tale and heed my warning.

3C0bnFhjkgYP9mWORKg6cA	5.0	"b'When I first started working Uptown I wanted to get a ""street hotdog"" since I had always associated the downtown life with a great frank (don\'t ask me why, maybe too many movies). On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.\n\nFast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I\'m in one of those rare moods where I just can\'t decide what I\'m hankering for.\n\nI came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself.\nThere are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats.\nFortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.\n\nThen I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.\n\nI will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don\'t have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.\n\nSo the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic ""the Chili Man"" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.\n\nCome for the dogs, hang around the cart for the conversation. Be prepared to repeat.'"

I mean, this is probably sacrilege to say but I thought that bacon jam was better than the one I had at the Ashbury.

For price comparison, the same thing at Long John Silver would be $5-6.\n\nThe shrimp were flat out awful.  They butterfly the shrimp to make it look bigger and then overload it with heavy batter before frying it.  I removed one of the shrimp from the breading and noticed it was probably 10 times smaller than the amount of batter used.  They use realllllly small shrimp, like 50-100 ct used in cheap shrimp cocktail platters at the grocery store.  \n\nThe fries are below average.  If you are going to have ""chips"" in your name, you need to have some of the best fries around.  They do not.  \n\n Their fish was okay because it wasn\'t overly greasy but again their breading is so thick and heavy it ruins it.  Fried fish should have a light batter.  In fact, nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use.  To top it off, their fish is served in the most natural of shapes.... a square.  If I want awkward looking fish, I\'ll head to the frozen section and get some fish sticks.\n  \nI saved the worst for part of the meal for last.  Their signature sauce.  That stuff was awful.  It tasted like it was 50% water and 45% ketchup and 5% vinegar.  They don\'t give you any tartar sauce, no malt vinegar and nickel and dime you for sauces on the menu.  I figured some other staples for this type of meal would be included but I was wrong.  I didn\'t even get to drown the bad food in a decent sauce, it was just more mediocrity.  \n\nOn to the most obvious quirk about the place, cash only.  If you are a cash only joint I assume you are trying to save the fees associated with accepting them and keeping your prices down.  Then why is the food so expensive?

They are soggy, ill-prepared, and above all, flavorless. 25 The breading hath no flavor but sadness, the fish no flavor but bland meal, both betraying its true genesis: 26 A frozen, preformed patty of processed misery. 27 God condemned this abomination and called, ""you are not one of my creatures!""\n\n28 ""They shall take only cash, as not even the credit card companies dare near their tainted field,"" God commanded.\n\n29 The seventh angel will pour out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice will come out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, ""It is done!"" And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. 30 Now the city was condemned to only ever eat from Pete\'s forevermore, an eternal damnation, a hell on earth, the sins of man so great, the punishment fitting with God\'s will.'"
3C0bnFhjkgYP9mWORKg6cA	5.0	"b""Omg Vic and his dogs are awesome sauce and then some! My boyfriend has been raving about the Chili Man and his stand for months now. I was finally able to have him come down during his lunch break for some of these amazing hot dogs. \n\nThe Chili Man hot dog stand is parked right in front of Chima's steakhouse Tuesday-Friday from 11a-2p. There will be a line, but don't let it deter you. Not only are the dogs delicious but Vic is friendly and funny. Despite the fact that you'll be waddling away after chowin down and may need a food coma nap afterwards, the Chili Man experience is worth it. JUST DO IT, as I will tell you in the next paragraph, even vegans don't have an excuse. \n\nWhat really had me sold was Vic now has vegetarian friendly tofu dogs! Seriously most thoughtful hot dog vendor EVER! I walked over with my bf just expecting him to fulfill his craving, I wasn't going to get anything since the last uploaded menu on yelp only consisted of red meat hot dogs. But to my surprise I was able to have one too, I was so happy! AND the Chili Man even offers VEGAN Chili Wednesdays complete with vegan hot dogs and TVP chili. So rad. \n\nOk I'll stop raving now.. Lol so my boyfriend had the life changer and I had a vegetarian friendly life changer with a tofu dog and minus the chili. We didn't talk to each other while eating, hell, I don't even think we took a breath. That's how good the Chili Man dogs are. All in all, the Chili Man is THE man and his dogs are righteous. Goes without saying he will be seeing me every week..which brings me to my next quest...I need to find a good gym. \n\nCheers!"""

-LfTBo0oa_uD454ScEW2XA	4.0	"b""If I may be so bold as to say this, Merry Ann's is a celebration of everything that is good about life.  The only downside is that in this case, too much of a good thing could possibly lead to atherosclerosis or some equally undesirable cholesterol condition.  Who can not honestly say they don't harbor a soft spot for those 24 hour diners, whose men and women work tirelessly throughout the night in order to provide us, the host inebriated, with industrial strength coffee and omelets at two in the morning?\n\nThe food at Merry Ann's, if you've never been, is pretty standard for diners.  Breakfast served all day, so you can get pancakes with the folks on Sunday morning, or pancakes at 4:47 in the morning after your friends push you in a shopping cart to the front door of this imperial majesty.  I was originally planning on giving them three stars, but Merry Ann's got an extra star from me for their bacon preparation technique.  Most places hand you burnt, crispy bacon-- Merry Ann's gives you greasy bacon still glistening with fat, fresh off the fryer.  The only way to eat bacon.  The aforementioned pancakes are a tasty deal too.  They're fluffy enough, and the taste can be drown in one of the three fine syrup offerings located at your booth.  Service is fast, friendly, and always ready to fill up your coffee.  And if you're at Merry Ann's, you will probably appreciate that.\n\nSo overall, Merry Ann's is cheap, delicious, and convenient.  Located in proximity to the downtown Champaign bars, you will always have a place to sober up for a few hours.  Champaign suffers from a dearth of 24 hour diners in my opinion.  I refuse, out of principle, to go to the Campustown IHOP.  Even if the stories I've heard about the place aren't true, drunk undergrads still sounds pretty terrible to me.  I miss the spots like Denny's and Norm's... but I feel like Merry Ann's does its duty, and does it well.\n\nKeep on keeping on, Merry Ann's Diner."""

The man is very entertaining, maybe a little off his rocker, but family friendly and keeps the line moving. I got my 2 dogs (I went very plain, bbq sauce, onions, and cheese) and was blown away. How you can possibly turn hot dogs into an artform is beyond me. The condiments are homemade and and toppings are fresh and bold. Vic moves like he could run his cart blindfold with an arm tied behind his back (he may even do it if you challenge him!).\n\nI can't wait to go back again and get one of his speciality dogs, he has rotating specials as well, keeps it from getting boring. You the man, Vic!"""

He knows his regulars and jokes with them. He engages the new customers. Word has it, that Cam Newton eats there at least once a week. I thought Cam was a pescatarian but if anything is going to make him turn to the dark side of beef, it would be the Chili Man's hot dogs. \n\nEvery week, he has specials and they are interesting takes on a ballpark snack. His regular menu is amazing itself. Next time I go, I am trying the Vinegar dog which is dill pickles, saurkraut, jalepenos, and mustard for toppings.

What I think I like most - and find most unique - is that he puts fried cheese on a lot of his dogs. He will throw a pile of shredded cheese on the grill and let it cook until crispy. He will then lay that down on the bun and proceed to layer on the other toppings. The added texture works really well - plus it helps keep the bun from getting soggy. \n\nAs others have said, Vic is a riot. I asked for the ""Life Changer"" dog and he replied with ""that it will my friend"". I then asked if he had any other dogs he recommended. After a long pause he tipped me off to a ""hidden"" dog that\'s not on his menu. Think ""Life Changer"" with a Cajun twist. Both dogs were really really good!  \n\nHe also serves up a really tasty chicken taco as well if he\'s offering it on the menu.

ZkzutF0P_u0C0yTulwaHkA	1.0	"b'WOW, this was disappointing. \nThe Potential: I had noticed the place and was pleased that SOMETHING looked interesting--judging by the name alone--in Plum for once. Then a co-worker recommended it to me as her family\'s go-to pizza place. She told me about their favorite cheeseburger pizza and mentioned that they also had a Thai chicken pizza. When pizza night came around last Friday, I asked my husband to check it out and order and I\'d pick up. \nThe Warning Signs: My first issue was not (easily) finding actual order info--a phone number--for Lelulo\'s, but instead finding the Slice service everywhere as the contact. Against my better judgement, I ordered via this shell website/advertising/delivery engine that is Slice. The app told me the restaurant would send a confirmation via email that the order was received. 15 mins later, I got a call from Slice saying that the restaurant was out of ground beef for the cheeseburger pizza. We switched to the Thai. About a half hour later, I piled the kids in the car and headed over from Murrysville. The place was so full of flour smoke from the ovens, there was genuinely a thick haze in the air, and much like walking into a BINGO hall back in the day, we all immediately smelled of smoke as if we\'d been working the ovens for HOURS. Where in the hell is the exhaust in that place? Was it just down for the night? Have they not been cleaning the filters, like, EVER? All I could think about was the poor dudes slinging pies and the Baker\'s Asthma they were working on. \nThe Reality: I was also disappointed in the look of the place. I mean, I love the Steelers too, but do you have to decorate your restaurant like my Uncle\'s sad man-cave? Complete with matte black paint and the terrible florescent garage lighting? Unsurprisingly, they told me the order wasn\'t ready and would need a few minutes, which translated into ""had not yet been started in any way."" So we sat down at the counter to wait. The woman at the register (possibly Lelulo? Dunno.) cautioned me against using Slice and blamed them for ""never putting the orders in."" I believe that, because adding a third party can only cause problems, but in a somewhat timely fashion they told us that the place was out of cheeseburger stuff, so....? The kids were hungry and getting cranky, so I bought them each a bag of chips and then spent the next 40 minutes trying to convince my 5 and 7-year-old that just because it LOOKS like a fun video game, Cherry machines are actually for grownups only and regularly texting my husband to confirm that no, we weren\'t dead in a ditch, we were STILL just waiting for pizza.\nThe Food. Now, I was still pretty excited being that the pizza ovens were real deck ovens, in which real character-laden pizza is made, vs the conveyors that churn out identical picture-perfect but uneventful pizza every 6 1/2 minutes. And, we\'d intentionally placed a pretty big order so we could try a range of stuff. Each kid had a small pizza, the girl with a plain white and the boy with a sweet-sauce red pizza with sausage. As mentioned, we ordered the Thai Chicken and we had also opted for something we were SO excited for--the Mustang Muffaletta Flatbread. The Muffaletta:  As you might have guessed, this was by far the most disappointing part of the order. Had these people never had a Muffaletta? Or a flatbread? Couldn\'t they have at least Googled it first? We expected an open-faced cracker-y pizza dough flatbread with Italian meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and classic Muffaletta pickled giardiniera-type olive salad. We got a sad, folded-over, ""wedgie"" with meats, cheese, and SLICED BLACK OLIVES. Black olives do not a Muffaletta make. \nThe Thai Chicken Pizza: The sauce on this was so confusing, we actually called the place certain we\'d received the ""Honey Garlic Sriracha Chicken Pizza"" instead, and I\'m still not convinced we didn\'t. In retrospect, I\'m convinced the sauce was just Sweet Thai Chili Sauce, undoctored, unchanged from the bottle it comes in. Cheddar cheese and thai chili sauce--NOT a good combo.\nThe Pizza: Lots of people raved about the dough, and the family recipe ""sweet sauce"". The sauce was fine; just your typical un-cooked canned crushed tomato sauce with some sugar and stuff added. Not terrible, but certainly nothing special. The dough was really disappointing. By the reviews, I expected a dense, chewy crust. We got dense in the form of thick but not at all airy ""bones"" and a thin, crackery bottom. My husband pointed out immediately what the issue was--the dough was Old. It had risen, but it had also fallen, over the course of the day. You can\'t use 11AM dough at 7PM people unless you\'ve arrested that rising by keeping the dough COLD until you\'re ready to use it. \nUnbidden Advice:\n1. Lose ""Slice"". Get a kid to make you a $100 website.\n2. Fix Your Exhaust\n3. Make your own damn sauce. Show a little pride and effort.\n4. Paint the place. \n5. Fry up the old dough and sell it as doughnuts\n6. Good luck.'"

I am a fan of his spicy dog, or really any that has his grilled cheese on it. Keep in mind that I am highly lactose intolerant, so for me to eat it: it's worth it. I am also super picky with hot dog chili from the style I am used to back home, but his tomato based stuff is unrivaled in that regard (though I still special order my stuff from home).

This is truly the worst garbage food I have ever had in any fast food place , it has absolutely no right to call themselves a fish and chips place.

Two bites of the nasty food and I got a stomach ache.  I will make sure to tell this to every person that will listen to make sure they do not have this expensive and awful food experience.

3C0bnFhjkgYP9mWORKg6cA	5.0	"b'In the words of Vic the Chili Man: ""What took you so long?"". As I write this review that keeps playing over and over. Why did it take me so long to try Vic\'s amazing hotdog creations??? \n\nWith this being Vic\'s 16th season I\'m definitely late to the party and as a Charlotte native there is no excuse for this. \n\nI will say that before the fall of last year I rarely spent time downtown but my volunteer work has me downtown at least once if not twice a week now and I know where I will be grabbing lunch for now on! \n\nFor my first visit I made sure I did my research. I explored the menu, asked friends for recommendations of their favorite dogs and learned that the wait was nothing to be intimidated by but to still go early. \n\nWell at 11am there was already a wait. I waited for about 20 minutes. The wait was very fun! Vic has hilarious stories and shares about his kids, the weather, the parking fun (trouble downtown) and so much more. This all made the wait so much easier. \n\nI was convinced that I would try the Naco Dog but wasn\'t sure of the other dog I would get. I was hesitant to try the Dog Au Poivre avec Frite. One I\'m a stickler for pronouncing things correctly and two it scared me with it\'s mix of flavors for the sauce. But I took a gamble and ordered it. Boy am I happy I did, it was AMAZING. I could have easily eaten 2 of those dogs. Now I\'m convinced that I have to at-least try Vic\'s specials cause this guy is a genius when it comes to mixing flavors. \n\nThe Dog Au Poivre avec Frite has just enough of the creamy sauce to keep the hot dog moist and the potatoes sticks mixed with the bacon give the dog a great crunch. The Naco dog was cold by the time I ate it but it was still good. The idea of grilled cheese at the base of the hotdog is genius but Vic is a genius so it\'s only fitting. Still not sure what Taco juice is but I\'ll delve into that on my second visit. \n\nVic the Chili Man\nS Tryon, Charlotte, NC 28202\nWednesday March 13, 2019 11:15am'"

The line felt like forever, but once I got to the front, ordered the Life Changer, and took a bite, I knew it was all worth it. Pure ecstasy filled my mouth. The name of the dog, much to my surprise, is such a huge understatement. The most delicious hot dog I think I will ever have. I Definitely recommend the experience to anyone with taste buds.

I\'ll stop by a few times a week. Make sure to select one of Vic\'s specialty sauces (homemade). I like to have a combination of sauces. Mixing some of the Spicy, BBQ, and sweet sauces, you create this explosion of flavor. \n\nThe perfect combination, order: Heroin Dog (it\'s on the menu!) a few of us awhile back founded the creation of that dog; its flavor became popular. You want to have Vic\'s homemade chili, fried cheese, Naco Sauce, a BBQ and a Sweet/mango sauce, topped with chopped onions and extra shredded cheese.

I'm all set to try every dog on his menu.... but always seem to reel in a Frito Pie. Call me an addict, I guess.\n\nHis prices are not to be beat on the street, and unlike most street vendors uptown, he's prepared to work with more than just cash.\n\nJust prepare for a bit of time spent in line, 20+ mins most days, but he will be sure to keep you entertained the entire time in line with his banter back and forth with clients and passers by.
