oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	"b""I've been coming to this dry cleaner for almost 7 years. They are the best in town. I've tried others... thought that I could find better... I can't! Great service and quality work! I also manage a luxury clothing store and I bring my stores garments there as well! I bring in simple alterations and all my dry cleaning/laundry needs!\n\nI am a customer for life!"""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'They lost 2 pairs of my suitpants and told me there was ""nothing they could do"" and then hung up on me.    Additionally they returned 2 of my suitjackets with broken butons, but I suppose, considering what happened with my pants, I should just be happy I got my jackets back at all.'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	"b""I have been going to this dry cleaning since I moved to Vegas and They opened around the same time back in 2009. They are amazing, they always know what I want and when I need my stuff ready. They have never ruined anything of mine. The owners are there almost everyday and know me personally. They treat me like family and I am only a customer. Anyone That rings me up knows me so they don't need to ask for my info ever. I have had items hemmed and altered and they have always done a great job. I would definitely recommend them! They rock!"""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'I\'ve only had my dry cleaning done here twice and both times were fine.  I knew that they did alterations as well, and when my BCBG skirt had separated neatly (the thread had seemed to have come out) I decided to take it to Green World Cleaners.\nBIGGEST MISTAKE EVER- DO NOT GET ALTERATIONS HERE!!\nI came to pick up a dress I had dry cleaned along with my BCBG black skirt that I needed to be stitched super carefully.  I paid like usual, and thank god when they gave me my dress and skirt I checked to see if it was just as gorgeous as it was before.\nThey had completely destroyed the back of my skirt and were going to let me walk out without a clue.  Not good for business.\nI questioned why the skirt looked super sloppy and the seamstress said that she knew she couldn\'t thread that certain fabric together but did anyway.  Then the owner comes up and tries to put my mind at ease saying that they would send it to another place to see if they could fix it, but that BCBG fabric was expensive and delicate so he didn\'t think they could.  They told me they would call me then took down my number again, and I left with just the dress I had dry cleaned.\nThree weeks later, I give them a call because they hadn\'t contacted me.  The owner answered and said ""oh yes I remember you, they couldn\'t fix it you can come pick it up whenever and get a refund"".... Well maybe you should\'ve called me like you said you would.\nI go to pick it up, walk in and give the clerk my ticket- she grabs the skirt in the clear wrap on a hanger and says have a good day.  I said, ""I\'m supposed to be refunded"" as I take the skirt out of the clear wrap.\nThe owner hears me and explains to the clerk I needed to be refunded because they had messed up.  I take one look at the skirt and immediately get upset over how it looks.  Instead of being neatly separated like it was when I brought it there (because the thread wasn\'t there to attach it), it was fuzzy, sloppy and completely destroyed.\nI ask the owner, ""what are you going to do to fix this, this was extremely expensive and you heard the seamstress say she knew she couldn\'t thread it with your machine but she had done it anyway"".  He replies ""you can take it to BCBG and see if they can repair it, I can\'t do anything for you"".\nMaybe if you want to keep repeat customers, you would pay for their clothing that your employee destroyed.  The skirt was $69 at BCBG, worn three times and now completely destroyed.  If i could give this place zero stars, I would for sure.  I will NEVER step foot in Green World Cleaners again and advise others to BEWARE!!!'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	"b'After reading the reviews of the cleaners closest to my house I decided to look for another dry cleaners and I was so happy to have found this family run business; I was nervous on my first trip as the elderly woman working the counter didn\'t speak English that well and my probing questions on how they treat their clothes and how long the turnaround was etc was a bit too much for her but once her son came over he was able to make me feel positive I was making the correct decision leaving my clothes with them. \n\nWhen I picked them up they were clean and fresh; I was dropping off some pants and the same lady asked if I would mind if she hemmed the cuffs up for me so I wouldn\'t be walking on them.  I said sure and started to step around the counter so they could measure the inseam and what not but she said that was not necessary and she could do it by eye....hmm ""ancient Chinese secret"" I presume; I gave her the green light for one pair of pants and was worried all week.  What I received was a beautifully hemmed pair of paints missing the Vegas street stains that had collected while I dragged them all over town. \n\nI ended up taking in all my pants for this treatment and have been similarly impressed every time;  I asked them to change a button out of one of my shirts and they explained they didn\'t carry that type of button but did recommend a few stores in town where I could try to find a replacement. Haven\'t done that yet but will be soon. \n\nThey also give you fee bottled water if you are a paying customer; I haven\'t been this happy with a dry cleaners since moving from Omaha.  As long as I live nearby I will be using this Dry Cleaners forever.'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	b'The staff is very nice and friendly.  However I took a new shirt in worn once and it came back with a hole in it.  I took it back to show them and they said it was not their fault and that shirts are check three times by three different people and no one saw the hole so I must have snagged it on something when I got home.  It was still on their plastic wrap and I showed them the plastic wrap was not snagged so how could the short be.  They said they did not do it and it was not their fault and would not replace it.  I went there for over a year and told them I would not continue to come back if not corrected and they said they did not care.  I will not be back and would not recommend it if you want your clothes to come back clean and in the same shape dropped off in.'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	4.0	b'Never a problem even on short notice. Turnaround time is next day if and when needed. Customer service is good. Always cleaned and pressed as requested. Better than most other places. A little higher priced than others but, you get what you pay for. Will continue to use their services.'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b""DO NOT GO HERE.   They are great until there is a problem.  My  comforter was  BURNED and neatly packed. Brought it back and was told to leave it there to be looked over because I might've burned it myself, and they'll get back to me. I have to come 14 miles one way so I asked her to call him but she didn't have any sort of contact number. She then says she does not know her managers name nor the owner's name because she just works there, and sees them whenever they show up.   Sounds absolutely ridiculous, I know. There wasn't even a business card, so I left my contact info for a call back which I never received.  They play dumb and it is frustrating  and unprofessional.  My comforter also has a strong lingering perfume scent that I can't get rid of.  Poor customer satisfaction, and they don't care how you feel about it, they just take your money!"""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'I am very impressed with the work they did on my shirts and linen jacket I dropped off. I even saved a ton of cash because they are a lot lower than Al Phillips and maybe even better quality dry cleaning.  I love their friendliness too!'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'I love this place. They really work fast. I was caught off guard if I wanted to pick up the next day unlike my previous dry cleaner made me wait three days. The alternations are very clean and well done. The staff there is super friendly and professional. Plus free water bottle; perfect for hot summer days in Vegas!'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	4.0	"b""I've been coming here for a few months.  I drop off 7-10 dress shirts a week and have never have a problem. They do a great job and prices are resonable.\n\nMy only complaint is the place is kind of dirty.  Huge clumps of dust on everything that is above what they could reach without a ladder.  I've seen this at a lot of dry cleaners because they use swamp coolers and not AC.  That said, it is one of the cleaner cleaners (say that 10 times fast) I have been too."""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'Very affordable! $15 for fur coat.\n\nAlso, in a very decent area...\n\nNice services!\n\nNear the most top commercial area.'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'This is the last time I come here! Usually they do a decent job. One time my white shirt had a bleach or a chemical stain. The  employee said that\'s weird because they don\'t use bleach and just dismissed the problem with out admitting any fault at all!\nNow a suit of mine had a stain that I did not recall ever seeing. I always point out stains on my clothing to them so the stain can be taken care of! The owner said to me "" we don\'t put stains on,we clean them"" and just dismissed the issue with out admitting that they might have accidentally stained my suit! I also pointed out two buttons were broken/chipped badly and I know  that wasn\'t from me!\nHe again just said what ever , ""yes buttons get broken all the time!""\nHe still didn\'t apologize or admit any wrong doing! I\'m sure in his mind he\'s never wrong or mistakes never happen in his shop! I went back to pick up my jacket once again and only the buttons were done and the stains were not even taken care of so they took it back and said they would take care of the stains. I just went in to pick it up and they couldn\'t even find it! It took around 30 minutes just to find it because it\'d been misplaced! They kept asking me questions and asked when I came in, was I sure I didn\'t pick it up and all kinds of questions because they messed up! The owner in an aggressive fashion looked around and they finally found it! The ladies who work there were nice and apologized. The stain looked better but it\'s still not 100%. The guy didn\'t even say a word, Mr. I\'m never wrong and no mistakes are ever made! It\'s time to find another dry-cleaners! Anyone have any good recommendations?'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	4.0	b'I would recommend this place to anyone.  I asked my custom suit clothier where he takes his expensive suits and this is where he recommended.  They have always done a good job.  I will say that the owner takes his business seriously so be prepared to know what you spilled on your garments.  Different liquids or stains require different chemicals (Ketchup is different from Olive Oil).  \n\nThe biggest thing for me is that I left about $90 in my jacket pocket and they returned with my suit and put the money in a ziplock bag.  Most people would not return that amount of money so it proves that they are trustworthy in my book.\n\n- Derek'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	4.0	"b""I drop off anywhere from 8 to 12 blouses (button ups) every two weeks to be medium starched and laundered/pressed. Not only do I receive all my shirts back in less than 48 hrs, I walk in, get greeted and they remember me by name (I tend to lose my tickets)!! My mom used to own dry cleaners so I'm pretty particular with who I let touch my clothes..... Green World takes my bet any day in Vegas!! Only reason for a 4: depending on who presses my shirts, I sometimes (and I mean once in a blue moon) have multiple creases on my sleeves which bug the crap out of me! Other than that, great service, decent prices, great turn around!! :))"""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'By far the best Dry Cleaners I have ever had! And I have gone through so many in many different cities. This place is cheap relative to what you receive. \n\nPros:\nEco-friendly\nFriendly Staff\nFree Coffee or Bottle Water\nVery affordable\nQuick Service\n\nCons:\nNone that I have experienced\n\nThere have been several times where they saw a button missing and just added one on without a request and didnt even charge. They have been able to get out every stained item I have ever given to them as well. \n\nI never write reviews, but I seriously think this place is by far the best and I would like to see them do well so that they stay open for business and I never have to find a new dry cleaners.'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	"b""Inexpensive, timely, haven't made a mistake! They always offer coffee and or water to their customers. I'll keep comin. I've reco'd this place to at least 4 people already & so far so good! .....Where's my commission?! Haha"""

oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'I don\'t recommend this place to anyone. The older lady at the front was extremely rude and yelled at me when I nicely asked why they altered something I told them not to AND charged me for it. I never said I wasn\'t paying her. Just asked her why. She interrupted me and yelled ""we already did the work you have to pay me this price!"" ""You pay me my money"" ""give me your card""  I specifically told her not to alter just dry clean my coats and my ticket even had a charge of $14 for dry clean only. When I got there to pick up she rang up the register for $60.  Her way of ""fixing"" the situation was to give me a 15% discount which was nothing compared to what she charged me and her voice was raised the entire time as I stood there silently. I literally ended up paying for it just to get out of there.'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'I don\'t understand why it is so highly reviewed.This place is dirty and over crowded. Every shirt that I have taken to this place has come back with stain marks,even brand new ones come back ruined. The girl at the counter is awesome but the owner of the shop a pompous ass and talks down to his employees. Even after a year of me going into this place he has never  greeted me or thanked me for my business. The only thing he has ever said to me, when my clothes were not ready was ""do you thng this is a casino, Im not open 24 hours""! He does not value your business!'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'I recently had some alterations done. Not just hemlines but wide leg pants narrowed, etc. Some of the items were lined. The prices were very reasonable, and the work was excellent. My laundry/dry cleaning has been expertly done. They always have cold water bottles for their customers to take!'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'Great cleaner, reasonable prices and same day service available. Tailoring service is great as well'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'5 Stars for customer service. Came in Saturday morning and needed my suits for work on Monday morning. Usually they require 2 days (closed sunday), but the owner (I assume thats who he was), made the extra effort to be sure that I received my clothes on time. I arrive Monday morning at 7 and was surprised all 10 shirts and 2 suits were done. Thank you!'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	4.0	b'I love this cleaners and have been going to it since a friend recommended them. They are always so nice and can get some of the toughest stains out (they of course say they will try but have always gotten out some tough stains on dresses that I have had). They have free cold bottled water in their refrigerator that they offer to customers. They also do good tailoring.'
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'Great prices..but you get what you pay for. After reading some of the other reviews, it appears I\'m not alone on this experience...\n\nAbout a week after picking up my dry cleaning, I go to wear one of my most expensive and favorite shirts. It was positioned at the back of the ""pile"". When I pulled it out, there was a MASSIVE stain and several BURN marks all over it. Attached was a note saying that ""despite their efforts, they were unable to remove the stain""...what a JOKE!\n\nI\'m sorry...but I never would bring a shirt in to a dry cleaner if there was a massive burn mark on it. Its quite obvious that they messed up and tried to dismiss the issue as a previous stain that wasn\'t their fault. \n\nIf you care about your clothes, you\'re playing roulette by letting this crew touch them. Every business makes mistakes, but at the very least, own up to them and try to make it right! These people deserve to be put out of business and I will be taking all my business elsewhere from now on. I would have given a - star if Yelp allowed it'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	"b""In a word - AWESOME!\n\nMy husband and I relocated to Vegas last October and have tried a couple of dry cleaners, none of which we were happy with. The last dry cleaners we used was conveniently located (5 minutes away), the staff was friendly, but unfortunately, the clothes weren't cleaned properly, some times not at all! The stains we pointed out were still there and there were even some new stains on the bottom of my husband's dress shits and suits, probably from being dragged on the ground when they were taken out of the truck to the shop - I actually saw this happen!! Plus they didn't have on-premise equipment - they sent it out to be cleaned. That's something new to us, being from the Washington, DC area, where most cleaners are on-premise, most with same day service. I did a Yelp search and came across Green World Cleaners and decided to give them a try based on the reviews and because they had on-premise facilities, even though they were about 20 minutes away. \n\nIt's completely worth it. My husband's shirts and suits are spotless with the right amount of starch, we can get our dry cleaning back the next day (as opposed to 3-4 days later from the other place), and the prices are reasonable. Anna who works there is super nice and they even have complimentary bottled water for customers. Totally worth the drive from  Summerllin!"""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	"b""Found this on Yelp, and it does not disappoint.  They are extremely friendly and honest.  Very good price and they did an excellent job.  You can trust them with your wedding gown and suit.  They offer free bottle of cold water in the store, that's very thoughtful of them especially during summertime.  Highly recommend."""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'The staff communicated in a defensive, arrogant, and unfriendly manner.  I left a work uniform at this cleaners for several months (they are only responsible for clothing for 90 days).  I had forgotten about my uniform and the ticket was misplaced.  \n\nI called today trying to find my misplaced uniform, they showed the uniform in their system and told me I could pick it up.  When I got to the store a few minutes later, they could not find it.  They said it must have already been taken to good will.  They said they always call before they take clothing to good will.  I explained I never received a phone call or a message.  \n\nI am writing a bad review not because I expect them to replace my clothing.  I am taking responsibility for losing track of my dry cleaning. This poor review is a reflection of their total lack of care, concern, and empathy for my disappointment.  I simply wanted to be spoken to with empathy and understanding about my disappointment that they did not effectively communicate with me after I had forgotten about my uniform for several months.\n\nAt no point did any of the employees or manager take responsibility for not calling or not leaving a message.  All that was repeatedly said to me was, ""We always call before we give clothing to good will.""  So we got in a cat and mouse discussion as I said, ""You didn\'t leave a message.""  She said, ""We always do."" Etc.  I left feeling extremely frustrated and like I was of no importance or value to the dry cleaners.  Not a good feeling.'"
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'This is my go to place for Dry cleaning. They are inexpensive, and have high quality work.

oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b""Word of advice... Take a pic of the clothes that you want cleaned prior to getting them serviced. Came to Green Cleaners because of the great rating and reviews... WHAT A FREAKING DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! I got a vest serviced and yes, they were fast, but they ruined the hell out of it. First of all, my vest was noticeably lighter in color and had white streaks. I know EXACTLY how it looked before and it was NEVER that light and it NEVER had white streaks. When I asked what happened, they told me that it's because of the silk fabric that it faded. EFFING BULL.... It's not even silk, it's made from 100% lyocell. Then they came up with more BULL reasons asking if I sweated in it?!?!?! Ummmmm.... It's a cover up and it's only the second time that I've worn it so it's basically brand FUCKING new...... and I don't know how their sweat looks, but I doubt it makes white MOTHER EFFING STREAKS!!!!!\n\nAgain... make sure to TAKE A PIC of your clothes!!!\n\nEFF THIS PLACE!!!!!!"""
oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	5.0	b'This place is TOP Notch!\n\nI had a little black dress then needed some TLC and I hesitantly took it to Green Cleaners since my boyfriend said they were the best and he had used them for years. I was so happy with the work they did! A new hem and mended slip in the back was only $18. I would of gladly paid $30 for the awesome job they did. \n\nThey are also fast, 24 hours later they had 30 dress shirts, 2 suits, and my dress done for $86 total.

I absolutely needed it today, so I told them if they can't get it done, I'll need to take it somewhere else. They told me it would be ready for pick up by 4pm today. I walked in around 4:10pm, and they spent 10 minutes looking for my pants (at this point, I'm already assuming they didn't get it done). Before he even found it, he told me it wasn't ready (obviously). I think he was hoping I would come back later, but I told him I need them immediately. I described what they looked like, and he pulled a pair that weren't even mine from the bottom of a pile. He proceeded to look, and finally found them in the bottom of another pile of clothes. Not hemmed, and very very wrinkled. I'm literally standing here as they get it done. It is now 4:50pm.

oiAlXZPIFm2nBCt0DHLu_Q	1.0	"b'I chose this dry cleaner due to the overwhelming high reviews on here. I\'m not one for leaving reviews, good or bad, but this was the worst experience I\'ve had in any customer service industry hands down. Fair price and the people I dealt with upon dropping off and picking up my clothes were very kind. After I inspected my clothing, two white dress shirts, I realized it splotches of dirty areas next to clean areas and went to get the problem corrected. The man I talked to, from what I gather from other reviews is the manager or owner, was the biggest asshole I\'ve ever had the displeasure to deal with. I was doing my best to be reasonable and just asked for my shirts to not be splotched and have it corrected. He refused and said to fix it I\'d need to pay for one of their deeper cleanings. After I asked for a refund he said ""absolutely not."" I understand it was just a light cleaning but there was basically no change in many areas of my shirts. Went up the street to another cleaners and they are going to do their best to fix the obvious issues caused by this man who ""personally scrubs every shirt."" I\'m paying more but it\'ll be worth not dealing with such an unpleasant individual ever again. My roommate did not have such issues but I guess it\'s a gamble if you get good service here or not. I do not recommend taking that gamble.'"

They also offer complimentary bottled water or coffee!\n\n I LOVE that they offer same day pick-up if you drop off the clothes early enough (since they do the cleaning ONSITE which is a rarity nowadays).

Owner (older Asian man) got into a yelling match with my husband over it and said it was our fault for dry cleaning it. Apparently it's our responsibility not theirs to be aware of what materials can and can not be cleaned. Even though the tag says to dry clean and I've never had an issue before. After arguing for seriously 20 minutes and my being reduced to crying the other owner (older Asian woman) tried to calm me down by saying she'd fix it and it'd be ok. She took it to her other company Sunshine Cleaners to have it stitched up. They full on RUINED the dress. Left it there for 2.5 weeks because they kept saying they needed more time until 11/3/17 when I came by and they said it was done. The dress was hanging on a stand in a bunch of other clothes. No plastic wrap, no protection, nothing. Just hanging in open air. I go to look at it and there are stains that look like oil burns or chemical marks in addition to messed up stitching all over the dress. The tailor at this place plays dumb and says she never saw it and has no idea how it got there. She proceeds to tell me it was always there.

Obviously it was caused by the bleach or whatever product they use. I went back to the store, the lady clearly knew what I was there for. ""We not cleaning it no more"" is her original word. She refused to do anything about it, she wrote me that note, said I should complain it to the brand A&F.

I came here to get my maid of honor dress for my friend's wedding altered here and dropped it off almost a month before the wedding.  First round of alterations, they needed to hem the dress, and take the waist in, they needed 2 weeks to do this and when I went in for the next fitting they had to losen up the waist area and alter it another inch.  They told me they needed a week and a half and that I could come in on the Wednesday before the wedding and if at that point any alterations were still needed they would be done on the spot.  Come Wednesday, my dress is not there and neither is the seamstress.  Owner tells me to come the next day (day before I leave out of town for the wedding) and the dress does not fit my hips anymore (literally can not move my legs) and was hemmed 2 inches too high.  Owner tells me completely arrogantly and unapologetic ally that there's nothing he can do about it, and that I can go find the seamstress at his other shop (Couldn't because I was on my lunch break) and that I just have to deal with it since I am leaving the next morning before they open for the wedding.  At one point I burst into tears from being so overwhelmed with how this dress was going to be fixed and from being talked to so poorly and the owner simply told me oh well then leave.

Made me feel good that they didn't push something that I was not there for and focused on the issues I was there for. Vet visits can get pricey so I appreciated that. The vet came in and seemed very knowledgeable and again didn't push super strong medication until she could see if something else could reduce my dogs allergies. Rather than push meds she gave me some ideas. I did end up getting some pills to help reduce the inflammation in my pups ears as they were almost purple from inflammation and her scratching.

I only came in here because I was on my way to the concert at Gila River Arena and figured Westgate would be swamped and I was starved and had to use ladies room.

That is not a good deal unless you eat 2 or more plates of the wings. So I get my boneless wings and they are heavily breaded which makes them more like popcorn chicken from KFC and there is no flavor on them. If there was any buffalo sauce it was very little.  I should have sent them back but we were in a hurry so I ate 6 out of 8..small meal. They are also out of the beer I want so I had to order 2nd choice. So the bill comes out and they charge me 12.99 for the wings. I sent it back saying I was confused on the pricing and since I only ate 6 anyways I would have been better off with the 6.99 for 6 which I was going to order anyways. They charged me 9.99. oh well I accepted that. So I gave her my card and when I signed for it, I see she charged me the orig amount.

The level of integrity and care during each visit from the entire staff is nothing like I have ever experienced at a veterinary clinic before.  \n\nI had a consultation with Dr. Hewitt for a possible root canal for my dog, Toby. Dr. Hewitt is one of, if not the leading vet for animal dentistry in the Vegas Valley.  He spent a significant time going over all of my options for handling Toby's canine fracture with me. I was ready to shell out some serious cash for the root canal if Toby needed it. Ultimately I settled on an extraction, a decision I made based upon the information Dr. Hewitt provided to me.  Some vets may as well be car salesman and strong arm people toward the most expensive option or will try to get you to pay for unnecessary procedures.  Not him!  Dr. Hewitt presents you with all of his knowledge but gives you the time and tools to choose yourself.  \n\nBecause Dr. Hewitt is so skilled he often books up very quickly.  I wanted to get Toby's tooth handled as soon as possible.  Since I opted for a standard tooth removal I ended up making an appointment with the first available vet.  Had it been a root canal I would have waited for Dr. Hewitt.  I was so fortunate and grateful that when he had a last minute cancellation he took the time to call me and let me know something had opened up.  He remembered Toby and wanted to get him in asap.

After calling three companies based on yelp, I decided to use Water Heater Pros because they were more than $100 cheaper than any of the other companies listed. At first I was leery because of price difference so I asked if they were licensed, bonded and insured - they said yes. I asked if I was getting the same specs and water heater as the other companies I called - they said yes. I asked if they could do it today - they said yes. I asked if they were going to pull the license on the water heater - they said yes...  I spoke with  Justin and he was great and informative. Their plumber Shane was on time, explained what he was doing, showed me why I needed to replace my hose, etc.  He got it done under an hour and half and was just extremely friendly, etc.  The price they quoted me is what I paid with no hidden fees or agenda.... Hope this helps you on your search for a plumber for your water heater :)"""

I asked for a courtesy call when someone was on his way, as I don't reside at the house. Got a call a few minutes after 8:00 and was told someone would be there about 8:30.

JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	"b""I communicated with these guys by phone and email. They were very friendly and quick to respond to all inquiries. However, they weren't able to immediately come out.\n\nI was initially quoted $950 (before physical assessment), which included installation of a 50gal, haulaway, and permit. When they came over to assess the situation, they told me that the only water heaters which would fit are Kenmore and Whirlpools. I definitely did not want the Kenmore, because I've had trouble with them (4 broken in 12 years). Selected the Whirlpool and found out that it would now be $100 more and only 40gal. I was sad to hear that. They also would not be able to install it until the next day.\n\nI ended up paying $1205 because I chose the extended warranty for 10 year parts and labor which cost an additional $200, but had the Yelp deal where it was $25 for $50. Even though I wish there were more options to fit in the space, so that the price would have been closer to the initial quote (w/o extended warranty), I guess it's not really their fault that there aren't. Therefore, I'm going to still give them a 5-star for being fast, friendly, and honest."""

She was very compassionate and really knew our pets. Moving to Vegas, we were having some really bad luck with finding someone even remotely similar. We had been to places that were overly expensive, places we're not sure if they did anything or what they did seemed unnecessary, places where there was always a different staff and you never saw the vet, and some just lacked compassion and didn't seem very passionate about caring for our pets. In particular, one of our dogs went in for her annual and we honestly don't know if a vet ever looked at her. The invoice we got doesn't even have her weight or her age on it!\nOur cat, Clyde, came down with a sinus infection and we didn't want to risk taking him to one of these places where he wouldn't get the best care. My husband found Cheyenne West and it was very close to our home so we gave it a try. \nI can't begin to describe how happy I am that we did!! The entire staff is warm and welcoming. We have since been back twice and the nurses remember us and our little Clyde. \nI haven't met the other vets at the office so I can't speak to them but Dr. Spurling is amazing! She is compassionate, thorough, and really seems to have a true love for what she is doing. What I appreciated the most is that she didn't take advantage of us financially and she put Clyde's health first. Coming from Chicago, vaccine requirements are very different and she could have advised us to vaccinate him with everything including the rabies. Because of the sinus infection, she didn't want to jeopardize his immune system so his first visit we just did blood work and started him on an antibiotic.  Upon the followup appointment (which they didn't charge us for), we gave him his rabies vaccine and am happy to report he is back to his healthy self again thanks to Dr. Spurling!! We will definitely be bringing our other pets and spreading the word!\nI honestly could not have asked for more from Cheyenne West Animal Hospital!"""

I was a walk in and was seen within 45 mins which for a walk in was very quick. We saw Dr King and she was very professional and discussed the tests need to be done on my buddy. I explained my financial constraints and  she told me step by step the prices of the procedures before doing them. She diagnosed him with diabetes and did inform me she thought there was a more serious medical issue with him but did not pressure me into feeling guilty to get more expensive testing (other vets have done that to me in the past)..She taught me and my wife how to give my cat his shots and give him treatment care. Unfortunately he was too sick and 2 days later I had to bring him in due to his condition worseing. Being a walk in again but only had a 15 min wait. I saw Dr Hewitt this time he examined Bacchus and stated he believed that his condition was too severe to treat and his quality of life would be terrible. He made a consult with Dr King and said his prognosis was guarded at best. It was a hard decision which I never had to make before but sadly I understood what was best for Bacchus. They were very patient and waited for my wife to get there before putting him to sleep. They gave us over an hour to say goodbye and then gave him dignity in his transition. They then gave us all the time we wanted before taking him away. The medical staff was highly professional as were the technicians and office staff. They truly understood our emotional pain and supported us. Even though our story ends sadly. I will take my other pets to this clinic. I would also highly recommend them to anyone else. I loved there was no pressure to get expensive tests or treatments. They also did not guilt or use emotions to get more expensive tests ( which other vets have used on me and other family members In  the past). They are top notch Vets and persons at this clinic. Thank you for taking good care of Bacchus and by doing so helped me and my wife get through the toughest decision I've ever made in my life."""

When I returned home I shut off the valve. Thankfully my water heater is outside and the water didn't come inside.\n\nI called Water Heater Pros the next morning left a message they called me back in two minutes. I let him know I had a 40 gallon electric water heater he quoted me the same price I was charged. He told me they could set the appointment for the next day between 8:30 to 9:00am, which is understandable since Las Vegas got so cold this week. \n\nThe next morning they showed up on time. Shane introduced himself. He started by draining and sweeping the water off my patio. Took out the old one and replaced it with the new water heater.

I have spent many hours with vets after being a special needs foster for shelters and rescues, so I\'ve seen the spectrum!\nI was referred to them by a friend who used to work there as a tech, especially because of Dr. Hewitt\'s specialty in animal dentistry.  They are always friendly and helpful, and were very kind when I had a beloved cat get diagnosed with a chronic disease.  Both doctors spent time with me discussing different options and diagnostic tests, and were wonderful with my pets.  When my cat\'s tests results came back, Dr. Hewitt spent close to a half hour on the phone with me explaining each result and what they meant.  I was so impressed with his ""bedside manner"" and how he handled such a complicated case.\nTheir pricing is very competitive and will help you file a claim if you have pet insurance.

She makes sure to answer any questions. I had a diabetic american bulldog and she worked with us to make sure our girl's diabetes was controlled and that she was comfortable until the end. \nDr.Lopez also saved one of my pugs. I had a pug who had torn intestines and was in the hospital for a week. Toward the end of the week Dr. Lopez asked if she could take my pug home with her and monitor her for the night. The next day my dog got to come home and has been happy and healthy ever since. I cant thank her enough for what she did for my dogs.\nDr. Kolmstetter is also a great vet there. She works with exotic pets and is fantastic. At one time I had several chameleons and snakes so she came out to my house and examined all of them. She took in ones that she thought needed some attention. She has been a great vet over the years for all other animals. \nI highly recommend Cheyenne West, especially Dr. Lopez. They're the best."""

Now that I'm in the area again this is a convenient option and they are one of the vets that still accept Care Credit, which in the case of an emergency or waiting for insurance reimbursement is very useful.  \n\nI came in on Saturday late afternoon.  It didn't appear to be that busy and I had not made an appointment.  They still had my information in the computer and I was surprised to learn I even had a credit.  Nice considering it had been at least six, seven years since my last visit.\n\nAfter we were shown a room a vet tech came in and went over Marley's history and his current issues.  A short while later the vet came in she immediately got on the floor with Marley to interact with him while asking me questions.  Marley has a cough so she suggested the conservative approach of Zyrtec, based on her exam and the symptoms I described, because I guess dogs can suffer from these types of allergies too.  They also call the next day to see how everything is going. \n\nI only took away one star because their prices are a little higher then some other offices in town and they aren't open on Sundays.

If you knew me you would realize how high of praise this actually is.\nThey showed up earlier than promised because the tech was in the neighborhood.  Turns out my issue which they had informally suspected to be a Bradford White warranty issue was a simple fix.  It was 107 plus in the garage yesterday and this caused a heat related safety switch to trip.  This reset switch is not referenced in the manual so I had no way of knowing it existed.  A quick reset on each of my units and they fired back up via the normal start up procedure.\nSo I ask the tech what I owe.  Nothing, just give us a call if it continues to be an issue and we will still fix it under warrant.\nI really appreciated the way the do business.\nFrom first phone call to fix was less than 2 hours.'

Thank gosh for Yelp and Water Heater Pros.\n\nI gave them a call and left a voicemail, and promptly got called back within ten or so minutes.  They asked me basic questions about my unit, assessed that it needed to be replaced and quoted me a price.  A great price in my opinion, given that the first company I had talked to wanted $300 more for the exact same thing.  He gave me a time of between 11:30-12:30, which was even better.  Same day service on a (almost) holiday?  Then to top it off, there was a knock at my door about 15 minutes before the time window - yay!  Not just on time, but early.\n\nI got to have Charlie work on my heater.  He confirmed it needed replacing, and after we talked briefly about the heater and what all needed to be done, I let him alone to work in peace.

After trying to fix it ourselves, I went to yelp and contacted a few businesses. Water Heater pros was the only one that straight up gave me an answer. Charlie said it's either issue 1,2, or 3 and gave ballpark estimates. We set up an appt for the same day. He was here within 30 minutes to save the day! He got it to stay lit and pointed out the issue and gave some amazing  advice. He was very honest and in my opinion went above and beyond.

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""This review covers two separate services, dog boarding and emergency veterinary care.\n\nDog Boarding: We bring our dog here for boarding when we travel and he can't come with us. The staff is wonderful and I know our pup gets the best care while we're gone!  We do upgrade to a suite to give our active guy a bit more room, but I feel the extra cost is well worth it!\n\nEmergency Veterinary Care: On our most recent trip, one of our kitties ended up needing emergency care due to a bladder blockage. Dr. Lopez was amazing and took great care of our guy!  She called multiple times every day to provide updates and to let us know what the next steps would be.  While it was difficult being far away when one of our fur babies was sick, I always felt he was getting great care.\n\nAfter our experience with the emergency with our cat, I'm even more convinced that Cheyenne West is the perfect place to board our dog. I know that he would receive excellent care if something were to happen while we were gone!\n\nThe facility is very nice and clean in both the boarding and veterinary areas. You can tell the doctors and staff really care about the animals. \n\nThank you so much Cheyenne West Animal Hospital!"""

So this has me very confused because 11 tables were available but they weren't bused.\n\nI told the hostess that the 30 minute wait is bullshit because from where I'm standing, I counted off the tables available.\n\nShe acknowledged the free tables, but gave the excuse the kitchen is backed up.  That's not my problem, wouldn't it be nice to allow us to sit and have drinks for a while? The light clicked on and she agreed to sit us.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and apologized ahead of time for delays from the kitchen. We ordered appetizers, and beer. The appetizer came out really fast. We ordered our meals shortly after going through the appetizer.\n\nI ordered the Cobb Salad and chili. Chili came out with the rest of my tables food, but the salad did not make it. She said she was heading back to grab the salad. 1 bowl of chili later I was told that the kitchen ran out of mixed greens, but someone had ran out to grab mixed greens from somewhere. She did bring some fries to the table to hold me over, thank you I liked that.  By the time the salad arrived my party was ready to leave.\n\nI can't remember our waitress' name but she made a bad situation better by keeping me in the loop, and hooking me up with some fries. The blame lies directly with the manager of this restaurant. He should be demoted and forced to rinse mixed greens for the next ten years.  Asinine having people wait when there are available seats to be filled.   Instead we were left to stand by the door staring at empty seats like a bunch of gibonni's.\n\nBefore we even pulled up my Girl Friend told us that she's been to this Hooters 3 times before and each time was a train wreck of an experience. She was dead on the money this place is a circus.  For me I'm walking away from Hooters for good. I'm sure a chimp could run this store better then the current manager. Noob!"""

Found the Water Heater Pros on Yelp and called them up first thing this morning. I spoke with Justin who was incredibly helpful and gave me an ""estimate"" over the phone. We spoke about my needs and what I currently had. I scheduled my appointment for today as they had a spot available between 11 and 1pm. I received a call from Charles a little after 9am. Charles stated they had a cancellation and could be by in about a 30minutes which moved my time slot to much earlier. Outstanding! Charles and Kevin arrived on time and were professional, courteous and informative. They wasted no time replacing my water heater and even a valve and piping that was corroded. They took the time to answer questions and provide tips on extending the life and maintaining the new water heater. The whole process took them less than two hours start to finish. They took all the old parts with them that they removed and cleaned up the area before leaving. The new water heater is a much higher quality than you\'ll find on your own and the workmanship was great! Charles and Kevin were very personable and worked while carrying a conversation. They seem to really care about their work, their clients and the business image they present. If you find yourself needing your water heater replaced, I highly recommend you contact Water Heater Pros and give them your business. You won\'t regret it. No offense Charles but, I hope I don\'t need your services again any time soon, If I do, I will be contacting you again!

Cheyenne West is one of the places that gives free checkups for cats adopted from the shelter, so we brought him in to get checked out. I could tell that something did not look right with his ears. Dr. Lopez discovered he had an ear infection. It appears he's had chronic ear infections for quite some time, so I had to bring him in for a few followups. The infection is now gone. They never charged me for the followup visits.\n\nMy other cat has also been spending quite a bit of time at the vest. About a week or so ago my wife called and said that he was foaming at the mouth. I told her to take him in right away. They were able to see him immediately. Dr. Lopez called me to explain everything that was going on with him and to explain our options. He ended up having to stay a couple of nights there. Dr. Lopez called to say it appeared he had a severe case of pancreatitis. She explained everything in detail and again gave me my options. When I picked him up they sent me home with an antibiotic. He looked very bad. I don't think Dr. Lopez or I thought he would make it through the weekend. He wasn't eating or drinking. They game him an appetite stimulant and pain medicine. He is still on the road to recovery, but he's eating, drinking, purring and about 90% better. I thought for sure I was going to lose him. I am very grateful to Dr. Lopez for helping pull him out of the woods."""

I had a sick husky pup and had no appointment but the lady at the front desk was so helpful. We were walk-ins but the lady made the new patient process so quick and smooth. She was very funny and sweet and concerned for our pup. There was a few people waiting however the wait was not long. Everyone was seen so quickly. My puppy is very vocal with anxiety towards people so he was barking at everyone. The staff was so patient and understanding towards him. We saw Dr. Spurling and she was fantastic. She was warned he would be vocal so before the exam she allowed him to get comfortable with her. After a few barks she got my pup to calm down. She was great she was definitely knowledgeable, concerned, and patient. We look forward to seeing her in the future. The checkout process went quickly as well. Overall definitely a great veterinary hospital, very clean and spacious with a good amount of seating as well. The pricing is very reasonable and they go over everything before you pay.

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""Let me start off by saying that I have been at this vet for a few years now but have always had a delightful visit regardless of the circumstances. \n\nMy cat Mischie passed away last November due to something that caused seizures that just would NOT stop.. I was in and out of this hospital for a week straight and was so frustrated at the lack of progress... Although I know it was isn't the hospitals fault. She passed away while I was at work which devastated me.. Buy what really stunned me was when the vets here would call and ask about her condition.. So I let them know she had passed. I received a condolence card signed by everyone in the office through the mail about a week later and bawled my eyes out. \n\nI adopted a puppy about half a year later and Dr Lopez has been his primary vet and she is absolutely amazing to him. She always greets him with a good back rub and scratching and he loves it!!\n\nAll the staff here at this location care very much for their clients and I appreciated their condolences and concern at a tough time.

They are not the friendliest staff I've met. They don't greet at the door. They don't make you feel welcome and have never seen them smile. \nI think that when you are dealing with pet owners you need a staff who are happy to be there and happy to help. I've had a couple experiences over the phone where they were rude and had bad attitudes. I don't appreciate that at all. Especially when I'm trying to tend to my sick dog! \nEveryone behind the desk is amazing and very attentive.  Front desk not so much! \nThey need to re- do the front desk.

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""I'm feeling so blessed that i found Dr.Mauer on the internet a few weeks ago as I had an 8 month old puppy suffering with a hip that was out of the socket and a wrong diagnosis from a veterinarian that I had taken my little dog to previously before finding Dr.Mauer.\nHe wasn't putting any weight on his leg and he was crying out in pain continuously. I took him to a vet with  40 yrs exp for an X-ray. She told me it was only a sprain.  I had made an appointment in 10 days to get him neutered and when he wasn't any better I asked for another x-ray. Now she finds that his hip was out of the socket and while he was under with  his neuter she tried to put it back in. He was in worse pain and cried out just breaking my heart continuously crying . I wanted to have an orthopedic surgeon ready because in my heart I didn't feel he was going to get better. I checked out another veterinary clinic with orthopedic surgeons and a MRI machine, CT scanner, water therapy etc sounded great but after reading the reviews I knew I needed to keep searching.\nIt was the Friday before his appt to get his stitches out the following Monday when I found an article about a veterinarian who travels the country doing seminars on stem cell therapy for animals and he's also a very experienced orthopedic surgeon with wonderful reviews. I called him and was very surprised when he answered and he explained he takes his own calls. I explained what was going on with my little dog and he told me don't you worry!  He said that he was in Colorado but that he would be back in Las Vegas on Monday. He told me to call the clinic tell them I talked to him and he wants me in Monday. I asked if he thought it might be possible that I could do it around the same time that I was having to take him in to get his stitches out from his neuter because he gets carsick. He told me he would take his stitches out when I brought him in to be examined. I could hardly wait for Monday. My little dog would scream out in pain if he even moved wrong while he was napping. \nSo I got right in that Monday morning \nand when he came back from taking him to the back to remove all the stitches he asked me who the veterinarian was who did his neuter because he said he hasn't seen material like that used since the olden days! \nThen he asked me if she's also the one that missed read the first x-ray I said \nyes. He didn't say anything bad about her\nhe just shook his head. However, he showed me on the x-ray that her clinic sent over how his hip would NEVER have gone back into the socket.\nI could see it easily and it was then and I was overcome with such grief how my little guy had suffered needlessly because I didn't take him for a second opinion right away when he was still crying in such pain. Dr Mauer explained that with his type of injury it should've been fixed right away. He explained to me what he needed to do to give him back his leg and letting me know it was going to be a very delicate surgery and what his recovery was going to be like.\nI felt such peace and a calmness come over me that I knew that I had been very lucky and blessed to find this man.\nI had just been so upset seeing my little boy in so much pain for so long . \nThree days later he had major surgery. He had to cut away the injured bone and pull down muscle for padding in between the two bones.  He got to come home the same day with just a little incision. I only gave him pain medication for two days and I could tell he wasn't hurting bad anymore. He wasn't crying anymore not even once. Jasper had laser therapy for two weeks which we just finished yesterday.  It was explained to me it helps with healing and circulation. \nIm a believer! I am so thrilled with Jasper's recovery. After his first laser therapy just a few days after his surgery he was toe tapping the foot. Meaning putting it down on the ground just for a second. Dr.Mauer explained just what he was going to be able to do with his leg and when. He is putting all his weight on it today on and off it's a miracle. He hasn't had use of his leg since he hurt it. It's been almost 2 mos. I just saw him run a few min ago playing with my other dog. I'm so happy.\nI wish everyone could know of him and how great he is.  He does not make you feel rushed and you know he knows what he's talking about! If you ever have need of one of the best specialists it's Dr.Mauer! \nHe did a miracle surgery.  It would still be a tough surgery on a larger dog but on my little guy it had to be so much more challenging.  Feeling so grateful"""

Once here, he completed the job in about an one hour and a half.\n\nHe came in, didn't diddle daddle, saw the problem that the water heater needed replacement and did the job.  They quoted us a price a week or so before and even after having to do some adjustments only still charged us what we were quoted.\n\nThere was no nickel and diming like the previous company we tried using (whose name I shall not mention *cough cough* Union Plumbing) who found a problem every which way and wanted us to pay for some ridiculous charges.  I found out one of those charges of $150 was for a part that was only $3.  Not $5, $3 dollars.\n\nSo yes I am ecstatic and happy that I was able to pay and give money to a company that's well ran, professional and that knows that money does not grow on trees.

He kept telling me over and over to move that I could not stand there (under the sign that says ORDER HERE)! Finally he puffed in my face and walked away. After relocating outside Kate G was super nice and checked on us. While drinking our beverages and observing the operation we decided this place was not organized, the manager was still a jerk to me (saw me walking towards him on my way to the bathroom and nearly ran me into another patron).

JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	"b""First time home owner and first time disaster with a water heater. I had no clue who to call or that I should probably have started with some details, like capacity. In my frantic search of the internet, the first thing I noticed was all the paid advertising based off my key word search and my skepticism immediately set in. After a moment of pondering, I then thought of yelp* where reputation is allowed to better influence such decisions. Like many other choices, I had my doubts when I saw all the 5 star ratings for Water Heater Pros but felt more at ease after glancing through some of the many and recent reviews, so I made the call. Of course I panicked once again when they asked me the size of the water heater but was quickly reassured when I answered 2 easy questions like the size of our home and the year it was built. With a tone of confidence and without any obvious delay of page turning or key tapping to find the answer, I was advised of the type of water heater most commonly used. Yes it was gas and if it wasn't right before, then I felt it would be correct now for our home.\n\nI was quoted a price that sounded very reasonable which included labor, delivery, installation, and disposal of the old wreck. I asked which forms of payment they accepted and made the appointment. Within 24 hours and on time, Shane arrived and got right to work. His professionalism seemed immediately obvious and round about an hour of time, he was finished. He had already set the temperature of our new water heater and informed me of the optimal setting for uses like the dishwasher for proper cleaning power. Because I felt I could have easily been charged for a whole lot more, given my obvious lack of knowledge about the whole experience, I expressed my gratitude with a little extra on the side that he could use, instead of a gift card, where ever he chose.\n\nWe are very pleased with the results and would highly recommend Water Heater Pros to anyone who wants the job done right the first time."""

Mia is a sweetheart, she checked us in and set up Licorice's chart, Skylar called us back into a room and she is also a sweetheart, she was so gentle with Licorice and Licorice felt very relaxed and comfortable. Skylar did her work up and took her temperature, listened to her heart and a couple of other things. Thank God Licorice is feeling good, we just needed to establish her with a new doctor and to get her nails trimmed. The assistants usually bring animals in the back to trim their nails, but we asked her if she would do it in the exam room and show us how they do it because Licorice always fights us when we try at home. Skylar said she certainly would and then Edith came in to help Skylar, as they always use two people to do this. Edith was also very sweet and both her and Skylar explained in detail exactly how they do it and then showed us, while giving us some very helpful suggestions on little tricks. After Skylar and Edith left the room, Dr. Hewitt came in and was so very nice. He gave Licorice a very thorough exam and spent about 25 minutes with us explaining how their office does things, and about different vaccines, and other very interesting and helpful information. It is so very obvious that these 4 people have such compassion and love for our fur babies.

I have two cats, and I've been bringing them here since 2005 (although the building was off of Cheyenne Ave until about 5 or 6 years ago.\nVery good receptionists and doctors' assistants, but the doctors and surgeons are beyond great. I took one of my cats to have her eye removed (infection), and I still shake my head over how good the surgeon was (her name was Dr. Lopez, but this was a few years ago). I myself have had a bunch of surgeries, and there's always been some sort of post-op problem (minor infection, etc.), but this eye surgery had no problems at all, none. Amazing.\nOur regular doctor (he also does surgery on pets' teeth, but we haven't needed that yet), is Dr. Hewitt, and he is also very good. I have one cat who doesn't like to be picked up, and one who is very skittish, but both of them like Hewitt, even when he probes and prods them.\nThe only complaint that I have is on the prices of the prescription food. A can of their cat food costs more than a can of tuna fish, which I think is crazy, but what can I do.\nOn the other hand, Dr. Hewitt has given me a lot of breaks on our office visits.\nTheir new location is just down the block from my house, so that's always a plus.\nOverall, my cats like it there, so that's all that matters."""
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	1.0	"b""It took me some time to write this, my heart is broken beyond and I am doing this to let everyone know that I will always blame Brian Hewitt for the death of my baby. For the rest of my life I will regret the day I walked into this Hospital.\n\nSuch a long and sad story of neglect through the years and me like the idiot kept going back to him because hey, we expect these doctors to save our pets, not kill them. Whatever his personal problems are in life, he took it out on my baby.\n\n4 years ago I had inquired about doing cataract surgery on my baby, Hewitt gave me the name of a specialist and I picked one on my own. Long story short and $800 later I found out from both doctors that my baby was in poor health to undergo such a surgery, really Hewitt? You knew this but sent me anyway, guess these doctors are all about sharing the wealth with their buddies. His teeth were rotted, one being abscessed and Hewitt never suggested any dental work through the years, really again..\n\nI'll just get to the end now. 5 months prior to him passing I had gone into Hewitt's office because they told me I had to come in for a checkup to get my babies deadly medication renewed. I go in, Hewitt comes in and the first thing he sad was, I looked down on the chart and I couldn't believe he was still here, really? 10 minutes later he says everything is fine considering his condition and sent me on my way with my prescription renewal. My baby growled and barked upon waiting to leave which was so strange to me because he never did that before, animal instincts I say and its why I decided to never return after that. 5 months later he had trouble breathing so I took him to another Animal Hospital, blood work was done immediately and came back with numbers so far off the chart it was just too late. Hewitt never did any blood work when I was there, as if he already knew but still let me walk out knowing my baby was going to be dead soon due to his severe neglect. Hewitt left my baby on this deadly medication for over 5 years and never once tried to ween him off of it knowing this would kill my baby in the end and it did. \n\nHewitt knowingly and deliberately caused the early unnecessary death of my baby. I will forever wish you the same fate in life and hope you rot in you know where..\n\n2/12/2018 - In response to the very sad response from Brian Hewitt\n\nYes Brian, you are in the business to save lives and I'm sure you've saved many but that doesn't explain to all of us why you neglected mine.\n\nYes Brian, you started dental school while caring for my pet, 8+ years, which is why I was in shock to hear this news from 2 other doctors, I have the medical records for everything in case anyone would like to see them. My baby passed with rotted teeth and 1 abscessed tooth, that doesn't happen over night sir if you learned anything in your years of schooling.\n\nI seen you several months before prior to him passing, you renewed his medication with NO blood work taken, even the year before that when you renewed it, NO blood work, it's been 2 years, please explain to all of us the doctor excuse for that one? Had you taken the blood work required, needed and necessary, we could have saved/prolonged my pets life.\n\nA no reply or a nice reply of, 'I'm totally sorry to have neglected your pet and will remember to leave my personal problems out of my work' would have been the manly thing to do but the typical doctor excuse was no different then they way you talk to your customers in person, you had an answer for everything but yet there is no answer of why you chose my pet, shame on you"""

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""I have been there three times in the last two months. My first visit was for my friend's 14 year old dog, who was having balance problems and rapid eye movements side to side. They quickly diagnosed the problem, prescribed an antibiotic, and she was fully recovered in 2 days.  Dr. Shaver is excellent, and the cost was reasonable.  The next visit was about a week ago. Same dog, but this time she was quivering and unable to get up. They ran diagnostic tests that ended up costing $550 for the tests, IV, shot, X-rays, etc;. An estimate was given to my friend first, so they are up front about the costs. I think it may have been a large expense for a dog that age (the dog was really old with other medical problems also), and perhaps they could have recommended euthanasia, They wanted her to take the dog to a weekend animal hospital, which would have cost another $2,000 or so. I understand their intention to provide care for animals, but the expense for  the tests was a lot, and once she declined to take the dog to the animal hospital, then they said that euthanasia might a possibility. We took her home, and she died peacefully 3 hours after the visit to the clinic.  The third visit was a few days ago for a routine exam of her 6 year old Shih Tzu, and a Bordatella spray. All went well, and they trimmed his nails also. The bill was reasonable again. I would highly recommend this clinic, however, be sure to know that you will be spending a lot to do full diagnostics.

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""My irrepressible beagle began having single episodes of suddenly yelping in pain when he jumped up to take treats from our hand. I took him to another un-named vet in town, who diagnosed him with an ear infection but they said his teeth looked great.  When I got him home, I noticed - no - he clearly had a rotten front incisor.  \n\nI took him to Dr. Hewitt and Cheyenne West for a second opinion, because he had the reputation of being THE veterinary dentist in town.  Rather than just having an ear infection, Dr. Hewitt discovered Harley had a herniated disc in his neck AND multiple bad teeth AND a serious heart condition!  \n\nI can't say enough about Dr. Hewitt's owner-side manner - he took a lot of time thoroughly explaining to me what my options were as far as treatment and the possible fatal outcome of my pup's heart condition.  When Harley went in for surgery to extract 8 bad teeth, and started having palpitations during surgery, Dr. Hewitt had a cardiologist lined up to do a phone consult while my dog was under anesthesia.  Top notch care.\n\nWith Dr. Hewitt's help - we've finally got a diagnosis of his heart condition, removed his bad teeth, cured his herniated disc (without surgery) and he's been one stable and happy pup for months now!"""

Shane got it done in 45 minutes as promised, even with me talking to him and getting very helpful and honest tips that was slowing him down.

YZeUH6zYS0dq5QHLYZhUnQ	4.0	b'I seen some negative reviews on here but went anyways. First off its a HOOTERS ! I had the naked 3 mile island wings grilled. They were good just as good as my favorite buffalo wild wings. We also had the lots o tots which were good also. The beer is ice cold, what more do you want? Can i tell you about the view? shoooweee.  If you like brunettes, pff say no more.'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	b'Since they are located two blocks away from me and my neighbor already has been taking their two dogs here and have nothing, but good things to say about them, I decided to try them out. Now although I have been content with my current vet, the truth is my dog needs to have her anal sack expressed about every two months. The distance between my home and my current veterinarian seems like an eternity to me on the drive back home with the smell permeating throughout my car. So if I can cut the drive time down that would be a great benefit to me. So after setting an appointment then later having to reschedule it for another couple of weeks later they were still very nice and accommodating about it. The place is very clean and the layout is very nice and straight forward. The whole staff seems really nice and very helpful, they are so patient with my dog because she is a rescue dog and suffers from anxieties. Dr Adams took good care of her, got her updated on all her vaccinations, added the influenza shot, and expressed her anal glands. The prices were $5.00 less than my current vet, also the drive home was really short. They are now my veterinarian. I will definitely come back, in about two months.'

(My 3-yr-old water heater suddenly wasn't making hot water and I couldn't get the pilot light to reset). I called on Wed morning and while they could have come out on the same day, my work schedule didn't allow it. So we scheduled for 8-10am on Thursday and the repairman arrived at 7:50am. I was soooo happy about that, as I need to leave for work at 10am. He did a quick test to confirm what I was told on the phone - that it was a faulty gas valve. 30 minutes later, he'd replaced the part and my water heater is fully functional again! These guys have clearly earned their high ratings and I'll be recommending them to anyone who needs water heater service. Thank you Water Heater Pros!"""

My husband explained the problem and they were able to help him over the phone. The man he spoke with was super helpful and easy to talk to (Wish we got his name). You don't see alot of companies willing to help the way they did, others would of taken advantage of the situation and charged some ridiculous amount to just look at it.

He told us we would need a few replacement lines and asked if we would want a drip pan placed underneath (which we wanted). He had everything needed to complete the install! He had it in and up and running within an hour!!! They were very nice and professional! Answered all questions! And it cost exactly what they quoted plus the new lines and pan we purchased!

YZeUH6zYS0dq5QHLYZhUnQ	3.0	"b""We came in to have the unlimited wings on Wednesday. Our server Nicolette came to the table with a smile on her face greeted us and got us our drinks. We asked her how much the pitchers of beer were she said she wasn't sure that it was her first night that she was gonna check. She came back and said with tax it was around 7 bucks. So we ordered one when she came back with it she was like sorry guys it's actually 13 bucks.( we wouldn't have order it knowing it was $13) but having it there already poured we took it. No biggie her first night she is learning the menu. We all order our wings it took about 25 minutes and only one out of 4 orders came out. It took another 15 minutes for the other 3 to come out. No sliver wear for other entrees. we Nicely stopped another girl and she had a terrible attitude about having to get us sliver wear. Don't bug her because she ain't getting a tip from us because we weren't her table. (That was her attitude) our refills on our wings took a lot longer than they should have. You only get ONE ranch or blue cheese with unlimited wings if you order more you get charged without being told. Come on hooters how is one tiny cup of ranch enough for unlimited wings???? Over all we understood it was Nicolette's first night she was very cute and very nice and working hard, but the food service was rocky and the girls are very pushy when delivering food one girl almost knocked a wing out of my dads hand reaching over him ( no excuse me or pardon my reach) just boom arm in the face. I know it's not a 5 star luxurious restaurant but at least have some manners. We will probably visit the bell road location next time we go!"""

They responded quickly to my quote request here on Yelp and after I sent a few photos by text they gave me an estimate that was on par with most and cheaper than a few others. \nThey promptly scheduled me an appointment that worked with my busy schedule and showed up exactly on time early Monday morning. They communicated with me professionally, told me what needed to be done and that they would be finished in about an hour. They worked efficiently, quietly and cleanly. They finished in the time frame they said they would and went on their way after giving me some simple at home maintenance instruction on how to help my new water heater last longer. \nOnly suggestion I would make is that they should maybe wear something more uniform like. They weren't sloppy or dirty, they just looked like the average guy on the street. Maybe company tee shirts with the business name number and logo would be a nice touch. \nHopefully I won't need their services again anytime soon but if I do I will definitely contact them first.\nI highly recommend Water Heater Pros!"""

Actually, several times I was the one who insisted on further testing to be done just to make sure that our pup was alright and healthy. \n\nThe regular shots/check ups were great and seem to be reasonably priced.  We had her spayed last summer and all went well except they shaved her stomach too high and a patch of fur still hasn't grown back and looks like it never will.

JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	4.0	"b'Best quote (over the phone) I could find. I called late Sunday and they were here promptly at  9a.m. the next morning. Actually they were 20 minutes early I could see the truck!  They drained the old one and hauled it away too. They worked in a cramped laundry area and wore booties over their shoes which I appreciated. They did some moving of lines and changed out some valves so the new wider water heater would fit, for no additional cost. About two hours later I had a new, ""Up To Code"" water heater with proper permits too.  They charged me the exact quote (of $975) they gave me on the phone. They guarantee labor for two years as well.**********The problem I had is they would not push the washer back two feet and screw in the hoses.

Clearly a lot of the people who sit outside smoke because there were ashtrays at all the tables.  It didn't bother us but she could have asked us if we wanted to have it there and removed it for our meal.

Hooters sounds awesome let's go, since we forgot just how bad it was last time. So this time I can at least say we had prompt service... which as you know is impossible unless you look like the type of a twenty to thirty something male who is a sucker for Orange booty shorts. Either way, it was quick.... almost suspiciously so for Hooters. We were killing time as I said so we started with the lots o tots. Crappy and oddly delicious as usual. Then we ordered a twenty piece boneless wings. Umm heres the deal.... what came out again suspiciously fast was not anything that resembled chicken. What we consumed actually treated nothing of poultry or even greasy saucy battered crispness. Nay, what we.managed to consume was cold, stale, probably reheated several times, broke my tooth, was hacked into tiny pieces, and literally splintered in your mouth. It cut the roof of my.mouth to hell. This is quite literally one of the worst meals I've ever had ... ever. (And if you knew my.father in laws cooking that says a lot). We actually left instead of continuing to order more food (we didn't even use up the gift card balance) on the way out we noticed that there was a sign for all you can eat wings. This irked me for two reasons 1. If I would have known that prior to actually tasting my did, I would have ordered it. 2. That was probably the reason or did was so awful. They probably.Just.make pieces hacked up.and let than sit until used. \n\nSo the next time you have Hooters amnesia, make sure it's not on a wednesday for all you can eat wood chips."""
JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	b'I had a water heater replaced two years ago with Hawthorne under warranty I paid 750 at the time.

Then he informed me it would be 825. To be fair he also offered a 10 percent veterans discount. I thought that was too expensive being that a brand new unit was installed two years ago. So we said no thank you. The technician said sarcastically good luck and left. We called Water Heater Pros and explained our situation to the gentleman on the phone. He took the model number and informed me he could have someone out to the house the next day to replace the unit for 545.

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	1.0	"b'I have been to this vet a handful of times with my dog and once with my parakeet and I never had an issue other than that they are a little pricey, that is until this past Saturday.  The lady with short blonde hair at the reception desk was VERY RUDE, no smile or greeting when I walked in, just asked me for my dog\'s name.  The technician that took us back was somewhat friendly though and the doctor was just so-so.  My dog was getting two vaccinations and his anal glands expressed along with just an overall check-up.  When the technician took him back I asked if they could clip his nails as well (I assumed this was a courtesy as every other veterinary clinic I have been to will do it at no extra charge when you bring your pet in for other things).  Not at Cheyenne, they charged me $18 for a nail trim that wasn\'t even as good as I could have done myself.  I called when I got home and looked at my bill to make sure that was correct and another rude receptionist confirmed that it was.  I also received a quote to get my dog\'s teeth cleaned and it came to almost $400, and that is only if they don\'t have to do any extractions.  The doctor said the procedure could easily run over $700 if there are teeth that need to be pulled.  When I was trying to check out I had to put my dog down on the floor and he lifted his leg and tinkled a little bit (he is a small Chihuahua, so it wasn\'t a lot).  That same rude receptionist with the short blonde hair just about came unglued when I told her he had peed a little on the floor.  She got up from her seat in a huff and marched off to get a mop, bucket and wet floor sign.  You would have thought my dog was the first dog ever to pee on the floor in that office.  I apologized again and she just said ""you just need to keep him away from the corners"".  Unreal!\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back to Cheyenne West and I will never be recommending them to anyone in the future.'"

(I tipped her like $2) I immediately called them and transferred to a manager by the name of jesse he was very short and not concerned with what had happened he just said to give him the last 4 of my card and my number and to call back the next day.

I let him know I did not do that like why would I tip my full amount her service was not good at all and even if she was I would never tip the full amount of my bill! He said he would wait until his GM would come in and SEE if they could reimburse me my money! I am just in disbelief this ""waitress"" changed what I had on the receipt.

After checking reviews here and on Angie's List I decided to call these guys. They were able to come out the next day with a new water heater comparable to the one we had. The price was right although we did have to pay extra for some parts that we hadn't counted on. Nevertheless, the work was done efficiently and we were up and running again in about an hour or so. Heads up regarding the maintenance on these water heaters. They have an anode rod inside which attracts hard minerals to it rather than to the inner tank.

In fact, there was a Yelp deal, but I chose to use the $25 off coupon I found on their website instead.\n  \nWe're very much satisfied by the installation work done on our new water heater by these guys.

Owner made a visit with installer and he was just a delight to talk with. Installer was Shane and he was a standup dude that was full of information. None of the fellas that came out try to upsell me or cheat me. Charlie the owner even hung out after the job was done to make sure we got some hot water (which we obviously did) and went even further to call an hour later to make sure everything was running as it should (which it was). Thanks, I hope I never have to call you again. But if I do, at least I know I'm getting great work done at a good price from some nice guys. I highly recommend them if you're having any issues.

JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	b'A few days after Christmas, our 14.5 year old GE water heater cracked and leaked water in our garage. Terrible time to have that occur during the holiday season!  I found Water Heater Pros on Yelp, I read the stellar reviews and gave them a call around 8:30am. I gave them the size of my water heater. The tech was up front with me, giving pricing on what the water heater would cost, the cost of the Henderson permit, and the cost of new water intake connectors if needed. They said they could be out between 10am and 12pm. I was shocked when they showed up at 10:07am ready to roll! The two techs had the new professional grade RUUD brand water heater installed in an hour! The fact that Water Heater Pros ONLY installs water heaters (no other plumbing work) gives you distinct advantages: better prices on professional grade units due to volume of installs, faster response times, and faster and more complete installs. The techs used a really cool RIGID copper tubing crimping device for the pipe connections. They replaced both my water intake connectors. Everything was cleaned up and is now up to current water heater code. Very pleased, highly recommended!!'

After a few text message exchanges he gave me a reasonable price and gave a time that was available for the technicians to come out. 2 technicians showed up earlier than the expected time slot, told me exactly what the price was that Justin quoted me and what type of work will be. The technicians got the work done with efficiency cleaned up and left both were courteous and respectful.'

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	4.0	"b""This place is good.. but just good. I highly recommend only coming here for the most routine checkups and vaccinations. There was a Dr here that I liked, she was a little blunt (especially if your dog was a little over weight) but she obviously loved the dog she was handling, and she doesn't seem to work there anymore. She was the one who told me about my dogs cancer when he first had it, she quickly returned calls if I had questions, and recommended a great specialty place. I've had Dr. Hewitt, and he was the one who told me my dogs cancer was back when I was here for a checkup. Usually I get this kind of difficult news from our dogs really sweet oncologist (so maybe I was spoiled).. but the whole scenario here was awful and awkward. I felt hurried when I was crying over my best friend, and I had to ask for a tissue (usually people just hand you one when you have snot running down your face haha). When my husband went to pick up his remains when he ultimately passed he said the girl behind the counter looked visibly uncomfortable/awkward and handed him a bag with our boy in it, it all just felt very impersonal. I know I'm being nit-picky, but I've been to other vets in the valley that go above and beyond just because they truly love what they do. \n\nThey also had an extremely hard time wrangling my cat when she needed her vaccines. I offered to help and they told me to stay back (I get it, owners can get in the way) so I had to watch them struggle with her for another 10 minutes or so before they asked if I thought I could get her. Um.. yes.. that's why I offered :). I easily scooped up my now super stressed cat and put her in this box to put her under for the rest of her vaccines (they said I could do this or bring her back another day). I was charged extra for this, which I guess I should have known, but it was pricey and no one warned me ahead of time.  I think if you want mostly affordable care that's routine and short wait times, this place is good. If you have a difficult pet or a difficult situation with the health of your pet, I'd recommend elsewhere."""

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	3.0	"b'I wanted to like this place. I been going on and off for yrs. I recently took my dogs in for wellness check ups at a 3:15pm appointment. Bentley my 10 month old 77lb Borzoi and Friday my 4yr old 76lb Borzoi. First thing was I have insurance for them and I only had a claim form and policy number for Bentley and needed one for Friday. First thing I ask was did they have blank forms. Was told ""no we don\'t have those on hand"". Hummm... I said to myself knowing I gotten them before. Then asking if I can log on a computer to pull up my account on the website and print a claim form also looking up Friday policy number. Was told ""clients are not aloud on our computers and that we don\'t have internet access, but you could email it, then I can print it"". Then I\'m like ""don\'t you need internet to have email?"" At this point I realize I didn\'t have my phone either to log on to send her an email. \nFinely was called back to our room. The assistant came in and again the first thing I asked was about getting the claim form and that could I log on the computer in the room to print it. The assistant had to go ask. So all of a sudden she returned with an empty claim form with her following up about there\'s no internet service but she had the empty form. I told her that the front end claimed to not have any forms and that I still need to log on to get the policy number. ""I am very discouraged"" I told the assistant. Mind you its now pushing 4pm and yet seen the Dr. The Dr came in very nice guy finally felt a relaxed feeling telling him what I want done. Talked a bit. I wanted titer testing, nails cut and fecal done on Friday and urinalysis for Bentley to make sure an old UTI was gone and a bump looked at. The Dr took Bentley back to get urine for the test but was unable to go through with the extraction. I think I heard him screaming. About 10-15min go by to return claiming he wasn\'t successful and that at this point was to watch him for any return symptoms. I\'m like ok and that bump was nothing. It\'s close to 5ish at this point. I wanted titer done for Friday but it was a bit late and the office closed at 4pm. Also I was aware of different titer testing and needed to make sure which one I wanted to do so I agreed to make another appointment for Friday. Did go home for a fecal tube to get a sample. If knowing I was planned for returning on Monday I wouldn\'t have made a big deal regarding my claim form or getting my policy number. So coming Monday the appointment went a little smoother, but felt I had some unsure answers regarding when my tests will return. I felt every time I had a question someone had to go ask someone else. Finally checking out I noticed they had the description of my dog wrong and ask to fix it. I didn\'t want in issue regarding my insurance with the wrong breed of dog was listed on the paperwork. Was told it was an easy fix. Was told the claim forms will be submitted with no issues. Well I noticed it being Thursday I checked and the forms have not yet been submitted to my insurance. I called was told that the Dr didn\'t fill out the diagnosis on the claim form. So he should be doing that today. Ugh.... again having to ask someone. I\'m very disappointed. Now I feel like I\'m having to do their job calling to make sure they do as they say. Oh and the Dr went on the internet in the room to look something up for me. THEY HAD INTERNET THE WHOLE TIME....\nAlso the nail trim is a rip off $21 and it still where long in my opinion.\nI was happy with the Dr even though he couldn\'t get in urine from Bentley. He did care very much about both their well-being. It was the staff and there unwilling to work with me on getting a claim form and policy number. It\'s not that hard for me to log in maybe all of 5min. \nUpdate: Test came back positive for titers which is good and negative for fecal worms for Friday.\nThank you for reading'"

Our cat oddly stands when he pees so we were able to capture the perfect urine sample with no contamination. We immediately put it in a ziplock bag and brought it in as instructed. When we arrived they had changed their mind and told us we couldn't use the sample so we just wasted our time and money. \n\nThis is the second headache I've had with Cheyenne. The first was when a curtain rod fell on my other cats toe and we suspected it was broken. We brought him in and they told us it wasn't broken since he was walking on it.

The lady with short blonde hair at the reception desk was VERY RUDE, no smile or greeting when I walked in, just asked me for my dog\'s name.  The technician that took us back was somewhat friendly though and the doctor was just so-so.  My dog was getting two vaccinations and his anal glands expressed along with just an overall check-up.  When the technician took him back I asked if they could clip his nails as well (I assumed this was a courtesy as every other veterinary clinic I have been to will do it at no extra charge when you bring your pet in for other things).  Not at Cheyenne, they charged me $18 for a nail trim that wasn\'t even as good as I could have done myself.  I called when I got home and looked at my bill to make sure that was correct and another rude receptionist confirmed that it was.  I also received a quote to get my dog\'s teeth cleaned and it came to almost $400, and that is only if they don\'t have to do any extractions.  The doctor said the procedure could easily run over $700 if there are teeth that need to be pulled.  When I was trying to check out I had to put my dog down on the floor and he lifted his leg and tinkled a little bit (he is a small Chihuahua, so it wasn\'t a lot).  That same rude receptionist with the short blonde hair just about came unglued when I told her he had peed a little on the floor.  She got up from her seat in a huff and marched off to get a mop, bucket and wet floor sign.  You would have thought my dog was the first dog ever to pee on the floor in that office.

When we asked for a table they hostess/server took a glance behind her and said they were all full.  I could see that they were busy but there were several empty tables, they were just dirty.  I asked her if we could sit outside and she pointed us to a table and handed us some menus.  After we cracked open the menu a man (manager maybe) came over to us and told us that our table was needed and we\'d have to move.  The server/hostess was still out there and watching the situation.  I asked her where else we could sit and she shrugged her shoulders and said ""I\'m sorry, we have no more tables.""  If this were any other restaurant, I would expect a little more foresight from the restaurants employee like, ""it will be a 15 minute wait to seat you"" or ""just a moment while I clear off a table for you"" but it\'s Hooters.  Since we were asked to leave our table with no other options presented to us, we left but I was super happy that it turned out to be a win-win!  The 11 year old got an eyeful AND firsthand experience on what happens when you pick the pretty girls with big boobs and little clothes - you end up with nothing more than wasted time.'"

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""This animal hospital is remarkable! From reception, to our tech, Andy, to Dr. Hewitt, my chihuahua, Minnie, and I were so warmly received.  To summarize the reason for our visit, I was considering dental surgery for Minnie.  And while we already have a regular veterinary practice that we adore, Minnie is a senior gal with pre-existing medical conditions, so I thought it valuable, if not best, to have a second opinion from a board-certified dentist like Dr. Hewitt.\n  Upon initial contact, I was able to secure an appointment in 2 weeks.  Once in the building, I was roomed within minutes of completing intake at the front desk.  In passing, I was able to note how clean and spacious each area was, as well as how kindly the staff treated every patient in sight.  The vet tech properly introduced herself as soon as we entered the examination room, and performed vitals and notes considerately.  A short wait later, we met the wonderful Dr. Hewitt.\n  After introductions were made, Dr. Hewitt gave his full attention to Minnie's medical history, thoughtfully taking notes and asking questions.  A physical examination followed.  He was calm, kind, and thorough -- one of the best bedside manners I've seen in Minnie's 16 years! He was very easy to speak to, easy to understand.  Our dialogue continued with weighing the risks and benefits of anesthesia, which ultimately brought us to a discussion of Minnie's heart murmur.  Dr. Hewitt took his time in describing this to me in a way that has [honestly] not been described to me before, complete with a hand-drawn diagram! lol His expertise is undeniable, but it's his love for what he does that truly shows and shines! Dr. Hewitt really helped me prioritize the next steps of care for Minnie.  I left with several questions answered and a thankful heart.  \n  Cheyenne West Animal Hospital is quite the distance from us, but proved to be well worth the time and effort.  Based on this visit, I would highly recommend them to pet owners near or far."""

Talked to Justin ""just"" for a minute and he answered all of my questions promptly and set me up with an appointment for the following day. Charlie came to the house the next morning right on time and got done within an hour and a half. \n\nI highly highly recommend!! Super personable and you can\'t beat the price they give.'"

I brought my very special needs to him for a dental consult rather than waiting for nearly 2 months for an opening with our other dentist in LV. BEST decision ever. \nThe lack of one star, however, is for one front desk member, Jackie. And from reading the other comments, I see others have had the same experience. Not sure how on earth one can make an appointment for a dog or any other type pet, and not ask the name of the pet. Surely, the appointment is not for me! Yea.. needs to be coached on that please. Left a very bad taste in my mouth that maybe she\'s really not an animal person. After the initial call, I made sure to end it with a ""oh, by the way, my dog\'s name is..""  Before leaving our appnt, I did ask another front desk member who Jackie was, and I could see that the disposition fit what I experienced on the phone.'"

They called Thursday around 9 and said they had a cancellation and could be here today between 10 and 11. They arrived on time and had a brand spanking new water heater installed by noon. What an upgrade from the circa 1993 model we had. All the 5 star ratings are well deserved!'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""Thank you Yelpers for steering me to Cheyenne West.\n\nMy two dogs see Dr. Lopez .  She is fantastic.  *Edited to add - had interaction with Dr. Hewitt and Shaver during an emergency and they are equally fantastic.  During a 2nd emergency (dog injured himself), Dr. Lopez kept us calm and took care of getting us an ASAP referral to a terrific surgeon.\n\nWhat a great facility.  Large, very clean, spacious, complete with a pet food section and pharmacy.   From the moment you enter the reception area, you feel welcome and you know your pet is in good hands.  Jacqui and the other medical support team members give my dog a ton of love to calm him during the check in process.  The Health Technicians are friendly and efficient.\n\nDr. Lopez begins each visit by actually getting down and playing with my dogs; lots of loving and focus just on the dogs.  Only after she establishes rapport with the dog and puts you at ease does she begin the exam/treatment.  It's like talking with a friend while the exam/treatment takes place.  She carefully explains anything she is doing, asks lots of questions, gives a lot of good information, and invites you to be very pro-active and participate.  She is so calm and loving with my dogs; I just can't imagine taking them anywhere else.  Even when taking the dogs for a vaccination, she spends time with them and you to answer any other questions you may have.\n\nOn my first visit, I fully expected this type of care to come with a huge price tag.  I was more than pleasantly surprised at the very reasonable fees.  \n\nI would not hesitate to recommend Cheyenne West to anyone who wants good and personalized pet care."""

fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""We've been taking our Yorkie to Dr. Hewitt for seven years and have always had great experiences.  I can't think of anything negative about anyone there.  Dr. Hewitt is amazing.  He explains things very thoroughly.  His techs have been very good as well.  They are always very sweet to our dog.  We've had only pleasant dealings with the people at the front desk.  We referred our friends to Cheyenne West A.H.  They got in to see another doc, but are also pleased with the service they've received."""
JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	b'Water Heater Pros deserves the five-star reviews they have on Yelp. I chose them because of all the great reviews, and also from recommendations on the NextDoor site. \n\nI got a quote online, and also by phone. They showed up on time, did a great job on the water heater replacement, and also showed us some things with the main water valve that may cause some problems in the future, due to sloppy work from the builder. It was an honest assessment and not an attempt to jack up a bill. Having been ripped off more than once for other appliance and home maintenance repairs, dealing with WHP was a breath of fresh air.\n\nI can wholeheartedly and happily recommend them!'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	b'Dr. Hewitt is the best and we never take our pets anywhere else. He is always honest and gives all options. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Awesome staff and vet care!'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""After carefully screening online where to bring my furbabies for their checkups,  and reading the good reiviews on yelp and elsewhere, I decided to bring them here. I wasn't disappointed.  This is the best animal hospital I have been to. Dr. Hewitt is fantastic. I will not bring them anywhere else as long as he is there to care for them. Thank you for your great service , and your kind and caring way about you. You guys are great!"""
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	b'The entire staff at Cheyenne West, and especially Dr. Annette Shaver, offer exceptional care.\nAll our pets have been with them for a while now for medical and for boarding. We would never think of going anywhere else.'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	3.0	b'Ok. Dr.s are very good. Reasonable wait time.\nPricing ok-ish.\nFront-desk and staff are all good but I have seen some eye-rollings. That is a super turn off from being scored higher.'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	1.0	b'I love Cheyenne west & I have taking my pets for years! I love all the doctors & assistants they are all great & treat my babies excellent! The receptionist(s) need to work on their people skills though, the past few times I have been there I have not been greeted they do not speak to me first, not even to pay my bill'
JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	b'Excellent customer service.  They provide a warranty with every water heater they install.  After one year, they replaced my water under their warranty.  Not sure why their water heater only lasted a year, but they stand behind their warranty.'
JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	b'Awesome service!! After reading Yelp reviews we called Water Heater Pros after receiving a high quote (when our water heater was under warranty still) from Action plumbing. They were the worst and even charged us a $20 fee to do nothing. Water Heater Pros were on time, did the work quoted for the quoted price  and were done within an hour (we had already drained the water heater). Very impressed with their professionalism and quality of work. Very honest plumbers which is hard to find. They will now be our new To Go To guys!  Thank you for helping!!!!'
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""This place is amazing. The staff is professional and friendly. They don't care if I'm just there to weigh my dogs and get treats or if I'm there for an appointment their professionalism is equally wonderful. The vets are great although my favorites are Dr Hewitt, Dr Shafer and Dr Anderson. They definitely educate and treat not only my fur babies but also myself with respect and dignity. \nThe location is always clean and they immediately clean when a patient has had an accident. The rooms are always kept clean. The bathrooms are clean and smell good. \nThe staff always offers water when having to wait to see the vet. The rooms are comfortable not only for the patient but the parent as well. The prices are a bit on the high end but you get what you pay for. Quality service is hard to come by and when you do you pay for it."""
JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	5.0	"b'No hassle, no negotiating, just professionalism!!\n\nMy tenant called last week to inform me that there was a problem w/ the water heater, so my management co called Warranty.  Five Star Home Services Inc (Avoid them at all costs) trumped up $595 of additional costs to the payout they got from FNHW.............knew I was getting robbed.\n\nNet, net..........called Justin, he detailed the costs/timeline and his team installed the water heater Saturday without a hitch.  \n\nLisenced, Bonded, ""Water Heater Pros"" as the name suggests...........they deserve our business in the Las Vegas area folks.  You wont be disappointed, I wasnt!!'"
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""This was my first visit, to establish care for both of my dogs, and I met with Dr. Adams.  The time and care he took to examine, educate and listen was exceptional and I couldn't be more pleased to have this peace of mind; knowing I found the right vet.  Skylar was terrific as well!  Excellent staff, clean environment and my dogs were calm ~ an added bonus!"""
fNil19SUfPAPnLQrYnFrGQ	5.0	"b""Just recently finding out my precious Dr.Younanian is at this location. I'm already leaving her a 5 star review. SHE WILL SAVE YOUR DOGS LIFE AND MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH. I literally cried when I found out where she was. She was the only vet to find out my dogs condition in an efficient and affordable manner when she was at another location. The staff there told me she quit to travel only for me to find out she's moved to this location. I only trust her and I'm so excited to bring my dog in for her to treat. He's been feeling ill and I've been praying to find out where she's gone. Thank you Jesus for research. ME AND TOBY LOVE YOU DR. YOUNANIAN SEE YOU"""
YZeUH6zYS0dq5QHLYZhUnQ	1.0	b'I hate to give a one star, but this place needs to get their act together. As a woman I was told that I could not sit at bar, watched two other women also be denied. I was served food with plastic silverware, and when I asked to speak with manager I was given the run a round. This place needs management, training, and equality! What a joke, not a good look Hooters two thumbs down.'
YZeUH6zYS0dq5QHLYZhUnQ	1.0	"b'I LOVE HOOTERS! When I came to this particular one though, I was super disappointed.. We were helped by 2 different waitresses they where not very friendly so I already started off feeling a little annoyed, but we decided to still stay and enjoy our meal. When we ordered our food ( there were 5 of us)  2 of us were going to order the 10 piece wings but the waitress told us about there all you can eat special that was only $5.00 , so of course we changed it. . they give 5 wings at a time and then when your done you order more.. So when we went to order our 2nd round the same waitress told us that it was really $15.00 each. When we asked her about why it changed she just said ""well Ill just get my manager"". The manager wasn\'t even apologetic! He just came over asked what happened and then said ""well we\'ll just charge you each for the 10 piece"". never-mind that we had to deal with their incompetence, or that our meal was completely interrupted.. SMH . Get out of the costumer service business!'"

JjcJVqhZXhP4tvOhg3fnag	1.0	"b""Wow!!!  This guy has called me, a WOMAN and left me a menacing voicemail. Charlie stated, 'He knows my number and my address.' Because I sent him a yelp message stating that he was dishonest and that I was going to write a poor review over Yelp. He threatened to sue me for slander and to take me to small claims court. He also changed the appointment time at the last minute and the quote he gave me compared to the one over the phone changed drastically. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This guy is crazy!!!"""
